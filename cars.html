            <p>The Mercedes-AMG F1 W15 E Performance, commonly known as the Mercedes W15, is a Formula One car designed and built by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team for the 2024 Formula One World Championship. It marked the return of James Allison as Technical Director and was driven by Lewis Hamilton and George Russell. Notably, this was Hamilton's final Mercedes car before his move to Ferrari in 2025.
                The W15 featured significant design changes, including a revised sidepod shape and a switch from pull-rod to push-rod suspension, aiming to address the handling issues of its predecessor, the W14. The car sported a predominantly black livery with a silver nose cone and teal accents from title sponsor Petronas.
                Throughout the 2024 season, the W15 secured four race victories, four pole positions, and nine podium finishes. Russell claimed wins at the Austrian and Las Vegas Grands Prix, while Hamilton triumphed at the British and Belgian Grands Prix. Despite these successes, Mercedes concluded the season fourth in the Constructors' Championship, marking their lowest finish since 2012.
                The season also had challenges, such as George Russell’s disqualification from the Belgian Grand Prix due to his car being underweight, which subsequently awarded the victory to Hamilton.
                In summary, the W15 represented a transitional phase for Mercedes, combining notable achievements with areas identified for improvement in future campaigns.</p>

            <p>The Alpine A524 is a Formula One car designed and developed by the BWT Alpine F1 Team for the 2024 Formula One World Championship. It represents the fourth entry by Alpine since rebranding from Renault. The car was driven by Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon throughout the season, with Jack Doohan stepping in for Ocon at the season finale after Ocon concluded his tenure with the team early.
                The A524 is powered by the Renault E-Tech RE24 engine, a 1.6-liter direct injection V6 turbocharged unit, complemented by kinetic and thermal energy recovery systems. The car features a double wishbone push-rod suspension system on both the front and rear, designed to enhance handling and performance.
                Throughout the 2024 season, the A524 participated in 24 races, achieving two podium finishes and securing one fastest lap. Notably, the team recorded its first double podium at the São Paulo Grand Prix and achieved its inaugural fastest lap at the United States Grand Prix. Despite these milestones, the car did not secure any race victories or pole positions during the season.
                The A524's livery maintained Alpine's signature blue and pink color scheme, in partnership with title sponsor BWT.

            <p>The Williams FW46 is a Formula One car designed and constructed by Williams Racing for the 2024 Formula One World Championship. The car was driven by Alexander Albon and Logan Sargeant at the start of the season. Midway through the season, Sargeant was replaced by Franco Colapinto, who competed in the final nine races.
                The FW46 was unveiled on February 5, 2024, featuring a livery similar to its predecessors, the FW44 and FW45. Notably, it was the first Williams car to incorporate an on-wheel multi-function display, moving away from the previous chassis-mounted displays.
                In an effort to modernize their manufacturing processes, Williams initially produced certain components of the FW46 using metal instead of the traditional carbon fiber. This approach led to the car exceeding the weight limit, resulting in a performance deficit of approximately 0.45 seconds per lap. Additionally, the use of metal parts increased the severity of damage during crashes.
                Throughout the 2024 season, the FW46 faced several challenges, including multiple on-track incidents. The team scored a total of 17 points, with a notable double-points finish at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where Albon and Colapinto finished seventh and eighth respectively. This achievement marked the first time an Argentine driver scored points in Formula One since 1982.
                For the Mexico City and São Paulo Grands Prix, Williams introduced a special livery to commemorate their partnership with Mercado Libre, an Argentine online marketplace. This collaboration was established following the signing of Franco Colapinto.
                In summary, the Williams FW46 represented a season of transition and adaptation for the team, with efforts to modernize their processes and integrate new talent into their driver lineup.</p>

                The VCARB 01 features a bold blue livery with red accents, reminiscent of the team's Toro Rosso days. This design choice marks a departure from the previous AlphaTauri branding, signaling a return to the team's earlier aesthetic.
                The car is powered by a Honda engine, delivering approximately 1,080 horsepower. It utilizes a double wishbone suspension system and weighs around 798 kilograms.
                During the 2024 season, the VCARB 01 participated in 24 races but did not secure any wins or podium finishes. The team achieved one fastest lap during the season.
                The VCARB 01 was officially unveiled in Las Vegas, with the team expressing optimism for the upcoming season. The launch event highlighted the car's new livery and design philosophy.

            <p>The Kick Sauber C44 is a Formula One car designed and constructed by the Stake F1 Team, also known as Kick Sauber, for the 2024 Formula One World Championship. It marked the team's first entry following the conclusion of their partnership with Alfa Romeo in 2023. The car was driven by Valtteri Bottas and Zhou Guanyu, both in their third and final year with the team.
                Under the guidance of Technical Director James Key, who joined the team in August 2023, the C44 was developed as a virtually new car, sharing only some components at its rear with its predecessor, the Alfa Romeo C43. The design incorporated a shift towards Red Bull's design philosophy, featuring pull-rod front suspension, downward-sloping sidepods, and squared-off radiator inlets. The car continued to utilize a Ferrari power unit and transmission, with the latter housed in a Sauber-designed casing.
                The departure of Alfa Romeo as a title sponsor led to a striking new livery for the C44, featuring a fluorescent green and black color scheme, reflecting the branding of new title sponsors Stake and Kick. In regions where gambling sponsorships are prohibited, the Stake logos were replaced by Kick's branding.
                Throughout the 2024 season, the C44 faced challenges in performance and reliability, resulting in the team finishing last in the World Constructors' Championship standings. The car struggled with tire management, particularly in efficiently heating the tires during both qualifying and race sessions. Despite numerous upgrades introduced during the season, the C44's performance remained suboptimal. The team's only points came at the Qatar Grand Prix, where Zhou Guanyu finished eighth, marking the team's highest finish of the season.
                In summary, the Kick Sauber C44 represented a significant transition for the team, introducing new design philosophies and branding. However, it faced considerable challenges in competitiveness and reliability throughout the 2024 Formula One season.</p>
